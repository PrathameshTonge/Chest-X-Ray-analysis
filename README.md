Chest X-ray Analysis Using Deep Learning Algorithm
This project focuses on the automatic analysis of chest X-rays using deep learning techniques.
The model is designed to assist in the detection of lung diseases, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or COVID-19, by analyzing chest X-ray images.

Description - Chest X-rays are an essential diagnostic tool for detecting lung diseases. However, interpreting these images requires expertise and time. This project utilizes deep learning to automate the detection and analysis of abnormalities in chest X-ray images. 
The goal is to provide a faster, more accurate diagnosis to complement medical professionals.The model is trained on a dataset of labeled chest X-ray images and employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and disease detection.

Features - Deep Learning-based Analysis: Utilizes CNNs for the automatic detection of diseases.Multiple Disease Classification: Capable of detecting conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis,
or COVID-19.Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation of chest X-ray images.
Model Evaluation: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for model performance.
